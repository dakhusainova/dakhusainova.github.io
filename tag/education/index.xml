      <title>How to make a presentation</title>
      <link>https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/presentationmake/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a good presentation starts with crafting the content. No matter how compelling your message is, if you don’t get it out of your brain and on to the screen in a simple way, you’ll be met with a sea of blank faces. So, where to begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an easy-to-follow structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you have to say, break it down into three simple sections: your presentation needs an introduction, body, and conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A compelling introduction. Your introduction needs to briefly sum up what you’re going to talk about and why it’s useful or relevant to your audience.
Offer a body of evidence. The body of your presentation is where you hit ’em with the facts, quotes, and evidence to back up your main points.
Sum up with key takeaways. The conclusion is where you loop back to your original statement and give the audience some key takeaways on how they can put into practice what they’ve learned.
No more than 10 slides in total. Who wants to sit through pages and pages of slides? No one, that’s who. By keeping your slide deck to 10 slides, even if your presentation is 30 minutes long, you’ll give the audience a chance to digest the on-screen messages in line with your talk. Using concept maps before structuring your slides can help keep to the point.
Limit the amount of copy on each slide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less really is more, especially when it comes to making a good presentation. Too much text and the audience will just be reading the screen instead of looking at you and feeling the emotional impact of your message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than six words per slide. Marketing king Seth Godin says we should have just six words per slide – that’s not a lot of copy. Choose your words carefully and rewrite until you’ve got it just right.
Think ‘bite-size’ information. We called ourselves Biteable a reason: studies have shown that information is retained better when it’s broken down into bite-sized chunks. Video is a great way to learn and research suggests it’s 95% more compelling than text.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last week 3</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I was in Kazan, a wonderful city, because it is my hometown. And I suffered over laboratory work, watched video tutorials in German and just rested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best day this week was the first day, because it was Victory Day. My brother and I were watching parade on TV. After that, I went to Victory Park and went to the center of Kazan. At the end of the day we watched the fireworks in honor of the victory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Markdown?</title>
      <link>https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/markdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/markdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends, last week was terribly difficult for me. I spent it doing laboratory work and the first stage of an individual project. Fortunately, I passed everything on time and did not forget anything, and this has happened to me more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
