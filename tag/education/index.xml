&lt;p&gt;The best day this week was the first day, because it was Victory Day. My brother and I were watching parade on TV. After that, I went to Victory Park and went to the center of Kazan. At the end of the day we watched the fireworks in honor of the victory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Markdown?</title>
      <link>https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/markdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends, last week was terribly difficult for me. I spent it doing laboratory work and the first stage of an individual project. Fortunately, I passed everything on time and did not forget anything, and this has happened to me more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
