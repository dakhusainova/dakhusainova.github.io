How much of it is in languages and why are there holivars about the advantages of some languages over others? If you are interested, I ask under the cat.\nFor a long time there have been “holy wars” in which various approaches in writing programs and in programming itself are discussed and criticized, mainly Object-Oriented Programming is criticized (one, two, three).\nEgor Bugayenko criticizes the PLO on practical examples (one, two, video), using the ideas of David West and, as I understood, recently went towards theory. The effectiveness of these disputes tends to zero. Why? Because all these disputes are already being conducted on the basis of the realizations of some thoughts, practices and opinions of individuals, and not on the basis of theoretical works. The scientific method and approach with its theories, hypotheses, axioms, experiments, proofs and facts in recent years in these disputes and “wars” there is no word at all!\nIn mathematics, as in any other science, any theorems and theories require proof. As an example: The Pythagorean Theorem. Theory comes first, followed by practice. In programming, this approach has not been followed for several decades. Everything has been replaced by dogmas and the opinions of individuals, who are sometimes called “evangelists” or “prophets”. With their verbiage, they promote only the ideas they need to the masses, without caring about theory or evidence (Look at conferences and presentations on IT). Where is science here, and where is religion? And are we not slipping into obscurantism and faith in words written long ago and not requiring proof? Have you heard about the flat Earth supporters? Does it remind you of anything in terms of approaches to persuasion and stubbornness?\nAnd for the last 30-40 years, programmers, blinded by religious beliefs from the preachers of PLO or OP, have been building abstractions on top of other abstractions, new languages on top of other languages, new frameworks and libraries on top of old ones. And why was all this necessary? For the sake of simplification and productivity of their work on writing programs. Only this path led to a dead end. Because instead of simplification, we got complication and now we are studying not algorithms, but APIs and documentation for another fashionable framework, and maybe several. Now they began to look for bugs not only in their own code, but also in someone else’s. Debugging code has to be done through tons of proxies, architecture patterns and design patterns, helpers, frameworks and libraries. And, as research shows, there is no gain in the speed of writing code from the use of OOP at all.\nA little history. How did it all start? First there was procedural programming, then structural programming, and then imperative programming came on the scene. Some people thought of introducing the concept of an object — this is how object-oriented programming was born. And at that moment there was a sharp turn that turned the entire industry into the state in which we are now.\nThe introduction of the object had to be theoretically justified. But that didn’t happen. Instead, each language introduced the concept of an object in its own way. And each developer of the language interpreted the postulates of the OOP to his taste and color. Particularly stubborn fundamentalists came up with Functional Programming based on mathematics, lists and higher-order functions. It sounds serious and even a little scientifically justified, because mathematics is a necessary and useful thing, but what does lists and functions have to do with the real world?\nWhat tasks does pure OP solve without using states and is there an optimal, convenient and correct way on the part of a person — that’s the question you need to ask the “prophets” of OP. And it is asked (one, two).\nFunctional language developers have started to apply some paradigms from OOP in order to move out of the field of applied mathematics problems into the field of real-world problems. In response, some OOP languages have implemented paradigms from the OP. And “Horses and people mixed up in a bunch” (c)\nAs a result, the implementation of pure paradigms of OOP and OP in current languages is like in a song — “I made it out of what was, and what was, and I fell in love”! And it turns out that without theoretical work and scientific basis, all these languages are just a figment of the fantasies and desires of their developers. And there are more than a hundred such languages! And it shouldn’t be like this! Ideally, there should be only 2 low-level languages and 3-4 high-level ones built on their basis.\nI can assume that when they introduced the concept of an object, they took as a basis what they saw around them — humans and animals. And this was the main mistake that would later grow to a huge size! Thus, inheritance may have appeared (ancestor-descendant and the relationship between them is …","date":1653436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ru","lastmod":1653436800,"objectID":"4002d403f2557b758230b2e626420ebc","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/ru/post/programming5st/","publishdate":"2022-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ru/post/programming5st/","section":"post","summary":"Science in programming — the past or reality?","tags":["Academic","Education"],"title":"Scientific programming","type":"post"},{"authors":["Хусаинова Динара Айратовна"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview Making a good presentation starts with crafting the content. No matter how compelling your message is, if you don’t get it out of your brain and on to the screen in a simple way, you’ll be met with a sea of blank faces. So, where to begin?\nCreate an easy-to-follow structure\nWhen it comes to what you have to say, break it down into three simple sections: your presentation needs an introduction, body, and conclusion.\nA compelling introduction. Your introduction needs to briefly sum up what you’re going to talk about and why it’s useful or relevant to your audience. Offer a body of evidence. The body of your presentation is where you hit ’em with the facts, quotes, and evidence to back up your main points. Sum up with key takeaways. The conclusion is where you loop back to your original statement and give the audience some key takeaways on how they can put into practice what they’ve learned. No more than 10 slides in total. Who wants to sit through pages and pages of slides? No one, that’s who. By keeping your slide deck to 10 slides, even if your presentation is 30 minutes long, you’ll give the audience a chance to digest the on-screen messages in line with your talk. Using concept maps before structuring your slides can help keep to the point. Limit the amount of copy on each slide\nLess really is more, especially when it comes to making a good presentation. Too much text and the audience will just be reading the screen instead of looking at you and feeling the emotional impact of your message.\nNo more than six words per slide. Marketing king Seth Godin says we should have just six words per slide – that’s not a lot of copy. Choose your words carefully and rewrite until you’ve got it just right. Think ‘bite-size’ information. We called ourselves Biteable a reason: studies have shown that information is retained better when it’s broken down into bite-sized chunks. Video is a great way to learn and research suggests it’s 95% more compelling than text.\n","date":1652313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ru","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"ae5d6d0eab86dcc0dc6f6d33ce2c37c5","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/ru/post/presentationmake/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ru/post/presentationmake/","section":"post","summary":"An overview of presentation","tags":["Academic","Education"],"title":"How to make a presentation","type":"post"},{"authors":["Хусаинова Динара Айратовна"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview Last week I was in Kazan, a wonderful city, because it is my hometown.

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\nYou can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.\nDepending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time.

Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required. In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can not to save the full version of the modified files, but to perform a so—called delta compression - to save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored. Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\n","date":1651536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ru","lastmod":1651536000,"objectID":"dca8565fcdcd26e32adec5472a23c373","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/ru/post/version-control/","publishdate":"2022-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ru/post/version-control/","section":"post","summary":"Here I will tell you about version control.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Version control","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?

Speech is necessary in order to be understood by the people around us. But it is worth distinguishing between the concepts of “conversation” and “communication\u0026#34;. Communication is not just a set of phrases, but a complex process consisting of verbal and nonverbal areas. The verbal domain refers to what exactly we say. But the nonverbal one is how exactly we do it. Nonverbal communication includes:\nfacial expressions; body language; tempo and timbre of the voice; subconscious reactions. In order to successfully communicate with other people, it is necessary to achieve harmony between the verbal and non-verbal components. So why can’t everyone do it?\nTo improve communication skills, I want to recommend you completely free simulators from a project called Wikium. They are available online around the clock, you can start studying right now, often you don’t even have to register.\nThere are also courses on this site. They are already paid, but the prices are very low, usually from 990 to 1,490 rubles. The courses help to develop a variety of skills: thinking, imagination, memory, verbal and nonverbal thinking, and so on. Why can’t I communicate Most often, the inability to successfully communicate with other people is based on problems from the field of psychology. These can be:\nshyness; low self-esteem; fear of “blurting out” some nonsense; fear of expressing your opinion; diction problems (lisp, stuttering, burr, etc.). The causes of these problems often come from childhood, when communication skills are just being formed. Here are some of the factors that can lead to communication problems:\nEntrenched complexes. Serious emotional shock. A long period of loneliness due to various circumstances, and as a result – social degradation. Strict restriction in communication with peers (parents did not let the child out of the house, did not allow him to communicate with other children). These are all quite serious reasons that require careful and long work with a psychologist. They manifest themselves in the fact that a person cannot even adequately respond to an appeal to him. He closes up, hides, can run away.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"ru","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"3cf5969cdfe6544f95314ed174320b0a","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/ru/project/project2/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ru/project/project2/","section":"project","summary":"How to learn to communicate","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Communication","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Cybercrime activities are carried out by individuals or organizations.\nSome cybercriminals unite in organized groups, use advanced methods and have high technical qualifications. Others are novice hackers.\nCybercriminals rarely hack computers for reasons unrelated to making a profit, for example, for political or personal reasons.\nTypes of cybercrimes Here are some examples of various types of cybercrime:\nEmail fraud and Internet fraud Identity fraud (theft and malicious use of personal information) Theft of financial data or bank card data Theft and sale of corporate data Cyberschantage (demanding money to prevent a cyberattack) Ransomware attacks (a type of cyber-sabotage) Cryptojacking (mining cryptocurrencies using other people’s resources without the knowledge of their owners) Cyber Espionage (unauthorized access to data of government or commercial organizations) Most cybercrimes fall into one of two categories\nCriminal activity, the purpose of which is the computers themselves Criminal activity in which computers are used to commit other crimes In the first case, criminals use viruses and other types of malware to infect computers and thus damage them or stop their work. You can also use malware to delete or steal data. Cybercrime, as a result of which device owners cannot use their computers or the network, and companies cannot provide Internet services to their customers, is called a denial of service attack (DoS).\nCybercrimes of the second category use computers or networks to distribute malware, illegal information or unauthorized images.\nSometimes attackers can combine both categories of cybercrime. First, they infect computers with viruses, and then use them to spread malware to other machines or throughout the network.\nCybercriminals can also carry out a so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. It is similar to a DoS attack, but criminals use a lot of compromised computers to carry it out.\nThe US Department of Justice believes that there is also a third category of cybercrime, when a computer is used as an accomplice to an illegal act, for example, to store stolen data on it.\nThe United States has signed the European Convention on Cybercrime. It names the types of activities using computers that are considered cybercrimes.
