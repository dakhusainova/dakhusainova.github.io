No matter how compelling your message is, if you don’t get it out of your brain and on to the screen in a simple way, you’ll be met with a sea of blank faces. So, where to begin?\nCreate an easy-to-follow structure\nWhen it comes to what you have to say, break it down into three simple sections: your presentation needs an introduction, body, and conclusion.\nA compelling introduction. Your introduction needs to briefly sum up what you’re going to talk about and why it’s useful or relevant to your audience. Offer a body of evidence. The body of your presentation is where you hit ’em with the facts, quotes, and evidence to back up your main points. Sum up with key takeaways. The conclusion is where you loop back to your original statement and give the audience some key takeaways on how they can put into practice what they’ve learned. No more than 10 slides in total. Who wants to sit through pages and pages of slides? No one, that’s who. By keeping your slide deck to 10 slides, even if your presentation is 30 minutes long, you’ll give the audience a chance to digest the on-screen messages in line with your talk. Using concept maps before structuring your slides can help keep to the point. Limit the amount of copy on each slide\nLess really is more, especially when it comes to making a good presentation. Too much text and the audience will just be reading the screen instead of looking at you and feeling the emotional impact of your message.\nNo more than six words per slide. Marketing king Seth Godin says we should have just six words per slide – that’s not a lot of copy. Choose your words carefully and rewrite until you’ve got it just right. Think ‘bite-size’ information. We called ourselves Biteable a reason: studies have shown that information is retained better when it’s broken down into bite-sized chunks. Video is a great way to learn and research suggests it’s 95% more compelling than text.\n","date":1652313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"ae5d6d0eab86dcc0dc6f6d33ce2c37c5","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/presentationmake/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/presentationmake/","section":"post","summary":"An overview of presentation","tags":["Academic","Education"],"title":"How to make a presentation","type":"post"},{"authors":["Khusainova Dinara Ayratovna"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview Last week I was in Kazan, a wonderful city, because it is my hometown.

Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.\nUsing Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\nYou can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.\nDepending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.\n","date":1652313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"An overview of Markdown","tags":["Academic","Education"],"title":"What is Markdown?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Khusainova Dinara Ayratovna"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview Friends, last week was terribly difficult for me.

Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required. In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can not to save the full version of the modified files, but to perform a so—called delta compression - to save only changes between successive versions, which reduces the amount of data stored. Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of a single file, keeping a common history of changes up to the point of branching versions and their own change histories of each branch. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike the classical ones, in distributed version control systems, a central repository is not mandatory. Among the classic VCS, the most famous are CVS, Subversion, and among the distributed ones — Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly in the syntax of the commands used in the work.\n","date":1651536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651536000,"objectID":"dca8565fcdcd26e32adec5472a23c373","permalink":"https://dakhusainova.github.io/post/version-control/","publishdate":"2022-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/version-control/","section":"post","summary":"Here I will tell you about version control.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Version control","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
