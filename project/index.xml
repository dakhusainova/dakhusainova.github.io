      <title>Communication</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all learn to speak from very early childhood. Speech is necessary in order to be understood by the people around us. But it is worth distinguishing between the concepts of “conversation” and “communication&amp;quot;. Communication is not just a set of phrases, but a complex process consisting of verbal and nonverbal areas.
The verbal domain refers to what exactly we say. But the nonverbal one is how exactly we do it. Nonverbal communication includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;facial expressions;
body language;
tempo and timbre of the voice;
subconscious reactions.
In order to successfully communicate with other people, it is necessary to achieve harmony between the verbal and non-verbal components. So why can&amp;rsquo;t everyone do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve communication skills, I want to recommend you completely free simulators from a project called Wikium. They are available online around the clock, you can start studying right now, often you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also courses on this site. They are already paid, but the prices are very low, usually from 990 to 1,490 rubles. The courses help to develop a variety of skills: thinking, imagination, memory, verbal and nonverbal thinking, and so on.
Why can&amp;rsquo;t I communicate
Most often, the inability to successfully communicate with other people is based on problems from the field of psychology. These can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shyness;
low self-esteem;
fear of “blurting out” some nonsense;
fear of expressing your opinion;
diction problems (lisp, stuttering, burr, etc.).
The causes of these problems often come from childhood, when communication skills are just being formed. Here are some of the factors that can lead to communication problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrenched complexes.
Serious emotional shock.
A long period of loneliness due to various circumstances, and as a result – social degradation.
Strict restriction in communication with peers (parents did not let the child out of the house, did not allow him to communicate with other children).
These are all quite serious reasons that require careful and long work with a psychologist. They manifest themselves in the fact that a person cannot even adequately respond to an appeal to him. He closes up, hides, can run away.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cybercrime is a criminal activity whose purpose is the misuse of a computer, computer network or network device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most (but not all) cybercrimes are committed by cybercriminals or hackers who make money from it. Cybercrime activities are carried out by individuals or organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cybercriminals unite in organized groups, use advanced methods and have high technical qualifications. Others are novice hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals rarely hack computers for reasons unrelated to making a profit, for example, for political or personal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of cybercrimes
Here are some examples of various types of cybercrime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email fraud and Internet fraud
Identity fraud (theft and malicious use of personal information)
Theft of financial data or bank card data
Theft and sale of corporate data
Cyberschantage (demanding money to prevent a cyberattack)
Ransomware attacks (a type of cyber-sabotage)
Cryptojacking (mining cryptocurrencies using other people&amp;rsquo;s resources without the knowledge of their owners)
Cyber Espionage (unauthorized access to data of government or commercial organizations)
Most cybercrimes fall into one of two categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal activity, the purpose of which is the computers themselves
Criminal activity in which computers are used to commit other crimes
In the first case, criminals use viruses and other types of malware to infect computers and thus damage them or stop their work. You can also use malware to delete or steal data.
Cybercrime, as a result of which device owners cannot use their computers or the network, and companies cannot provide Internet services to their customers, is called a denial of service attack (DoS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercrimes of the second category use computers or networks to distribute malware, illegal information or unauthorized images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes attackers can combine both categories of cybercrime. First, they infect computers with viruses, and then use them to spread malware to other machines or throughout the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals can also carry out a so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. It is similar to a DoS attack, but criminals use a lot of compromised computers to carry it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Justice believes that there is also a third category of cybercrime, when a computer is used as an accomplice to an illegal act, for example, to store stolen data on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States has signed the European Convention on Cybercrime. It names the types of activities using computers that are considered cybercrimes. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;illegal interception or theft of data.
compromise of computer systems and networks
copyright infringement
illegal gambling
sale of prohibited items on the Internet
harassment, production or possession of child pornography&lt;/p&gt;
